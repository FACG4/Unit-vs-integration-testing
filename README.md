### What is unit testing? ###
* Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation. Unit testing can be done manually but is often automated.

* Unit testing is a component of test-driven development (TDD), a pragmatic methodology that takes a meticulous approach to building a product by means of continual testing and revision. Test-driven development requires that developers first write failing unit tests. Then they write code and refactor the application until the test passes. TDD typically results in an explicit and predictable code base
* Unit testing involves only those characteristics that are vital to the performance of the unit under test. This encourages developers to modify the source code without immediate concerns about how such changes might affect the functioning of other units or the program as a whole. Once all of the units in a program have been found to be working in the most efficient and error-free manner possible, larger components of the program can be evaluated by means of integration testing.


* Unit testing does have steep learning curve. The development team needs to learn what unit testing is, how to unit test, what to unit test and how to use automated software tools to facilitate the process on an on-going basis.  The great benefit to unit testing is that the earlier a problem is identified, the fewer compound errors occur. A compound error is one that doesn't seem to break anything at first, but eventually conflicts with something down the line and results in a problem.

Simple example:

This a function that returns the sum of two integers:

```int CombineNumbers(int a, int b)  {
    return a+b;
}```
 </br>
This is the test for the previous function: </br>
``` void TestCombineNumbers() {
    ```Assert.IsEqual(CombineNumbers(5, 10), 15);</br>
     // Assert is an object that is part of your test framework
    ```Assert.IsEqual(CombineNumbers(1000, -100), 900);
} ```


</br>

### When should you perform unit tests? ###
They should be done as often as possible. When you are performing tests as part of the development process, your code is automatically going to be designed better than if you just wrote the functions and then moved on. Also, concepts such as Dependency Injection are going to evolve naturally into your code.


### What are the unit testing benefits? ###
* Unit testing increases confidence in changing/ maintaining code. If good unit tests are written and if they are run every time any code is changed, we will be able to promptly catch any defects introduced due to the change. Also, if codes are already made less interdependent to make unit testing possible, the unintended impact of changes to any code is less.
* Codes are more reusable. In order to make unit testing possible, codes need to be modular. This means that codes are easier to reuse.
* Development is faster. How? If you do not have unit testing in place, you write your code and perform that fuzzy ‘developer test’ (You set some breakpoints, fire up the GUI, provide a few inputs that hopefully hit your code and hope that you are all set.) But, if you have unit testing in place, you write the test, write the code and run the test. Writing tests takes time but the time is compensated by the less amount of time it takes to run the tests; You need not fire up the GUI and provide all those inputs. And, of course, unit tests are more reliable than ‘developer tests’. Development is faster in the long run too. How? The effort required to find and fix defects found during unit testing is very less in comparison to the effort required to fix defects found during system testing or acceptance testing.
* The cost of fixing a defect detected during unit testing is lesser in comparison to that of defects detected at higher levels. Compare the cost (time, effort, destruction, humiliation) of a defect detected during acceptance testing or when the software is live.
* Debugging is easy. When a test fails, only the latest changes need to be debugged. With testing at higher levels, changes made over the span of several days/weeks/months need to be scanned.
* Codes are more reliable. Why? I think there is no need to explain this to a sane person.

### Unit Testing Tips ###
* Find a tool/framework for your language.
* Do not create test cases for everything. Instead, focus on the tests that impact the behavior of the system.
* Isolate the development environment from the test environment.
* Use test data that is close to that of production.
* Before fixing a defect, write a test that exposes the defect. Why? First, you will later be able to catch the defect if you do not fix it properly. Second, your test suite is now more comprehensive. Third, you will most probably be too lazy to write the test after you have already fixed the defect.
* Write test cases that are independent of each other. For example, if a class depends on a database, do not write a case that interacts with the database to test the class. Instead, create an abstract interface around that database connection and implement that interface with a mock object.
* Aim at covering all paths through the unit. Pay particular attention to loop conditions.
* Make sure you are using a version control system to keep track of your test scripts.
* In addition to writing cases to verify the behavior, write cases to ensure the performance of the code.
* Perform unit tests continuously and frequently.


## What is an integration test?

</p>

* test the relationships between multiple components of software
* Testing performed to expose bugs in the
interactions between integrated components or systems.
* Combine and test individual modules as a group
* test the data that transfer between the modules

### When is Integration Testing performed?  
  Integration Testing is the second level of testing performed after Unit Testing and before System Testing.

### Approaches
  * **Big Bang** is an approach to Integration Testing where all or most of the units are combined together and tested at one go.

  * **Top Down** is an approach to Integration Testing where top-level units are tested first and lower level units are tested step by step after that. This approach is taken when top-down development approach is followed.

  * **Bottom Up**  is an approach to Integration Testing where bottom level units are tested first and upper-level units step by step after that.

  * **Sandwich/Hybrid**  is an approach to Integration Testing which is a combination of Top Down and Bottom Up approaches.
